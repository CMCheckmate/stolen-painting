We’re reviewing a situation involving a stolen painting from an art shop. The three suspects in question are the shop owner, the shop’s security guard (Rob), and a shop assistant (Karen).

Below are some explanations and reasons as to why the shop owner was the thief:
-	The shop owner probably turned off the security cameras as he would be the only one with access.
- Karen, his employee mentioned him taking the keys to the shop last night around 10pm.
- The security guard, Rob, mentions him leaving after 10pm.
- He probably took advantage of the above fact to return to the shop to commit the crime.
-	An email received on the shop’s computer shows the owner recently (one week ago) signing up for an insurance plan that covers losses.
-	Another email to an art valuation service regarding the valuations of various art pieces, including the stolen painting.
- The owner probably thus planned the theft beforehand and was researching its monetary value.
- The plan was likely to steal the painting and sell it off, while also being able to claim insurance money (insurance fraud).
- His motive was due to his poor financial situation due to his business not doing well.
